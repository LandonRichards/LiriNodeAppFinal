# LiriNodeAppFinal

This is the basic Liri node Application. Most of the code was boiler-plated from the video walkthrough. I left comments in the code as I understood the application.

This shows my understanding of basic Node JS functionaltiy, and also, the twitter and Spotify API's came in handy later...
